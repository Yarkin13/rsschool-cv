### Summary ###
I started learning HTML and CSS with Codecademy & htmlAcademy courses. I went through HTML and CSS courses there. Later, in December 2019 I got to know about RS School. I am self-motivated and self-educating person. I obtain new skills quickly. Though it took some time to understand coding process. I am interested in applying everything I’ve learned so far. I found it exciting and challenging.
